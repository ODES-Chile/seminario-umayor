	abstract = {Since 2010 an uninterrupted sequence of dry years, with annual rainfall deficits ranging from 25 to 45\&amp;thinsp;\%, has prevailed in Central Chile (western South America, 30\&amp;ndash;38\&amp;deg;\&amp;thinsp;S). Although intense 1- or 2-year droughts are recurrent in this Mediterranean-like region, the ongoing event stands out because of its longevity and large spatial extent. The extraordinary character of the so-called Central Chile Mega Drought (MD) was established against century long historical records and a millennial tree-ring reconstruction of regional precipitation. The largest MD-averaged rainfall relative anomalies occurred in the northern, semi-arid sector of central Chile but the event was unprecedented to the south of 35\&amp;deg;\&amp;thinsp;S. ENSO neutral conditions have prevailed since 2011 (but for the strong El Niño 2015) contrasting with La Niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts. The precipitation deficit diminished the Andean snowpack and resulted in amplified declines (up to 90\&amp;thinsp;\%) of river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central Chile and westernmost Argentina. In some semiarid basins we also found a conspicuous decrease in the runoff-to-rainfall coefficient. A substantial decrease in vegetation productivity occurred in the shrubland-dominated, northern sector, but a mix of greening and browning patches occurred farther south where irrigated croplands and exotic forest plantations dominate. The ongoing warming in central Chile, making the MD one of the warmest 6-year period on record, may have also contributed to such complex vegetation changes by increasing potential evapotranspiration. The understanding of the nature and biophysical impacts of the MD contributes to preparedness efforts to face a dry, warm future regional climate scenario.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Owing to the Mediterranean-like and highly variable climate of western South America, moderate droughts (20–30 \% precipitation deficit) recur every 3–5 years in central Chile, alternating with wet years. Since 2010, however, this region has experienced a continuous dry spell, including extremely dry conditions in 2019 and 2021, when annual precipitation deficits exceeded 75 \%. The substantial lack of rain in those winters resulted in severe environmental impacts (e.g., near collapse of natural forests) and augmented social tensions in the country. Long-term records reveal similar extreme dry conditions in 1924, 1968, and 1998, referred to as hyperdroughts (HDs). The climate drivers, past recurrence, environmental impacts, and social effects of HDs are documented here using station-based hydroclimate observations, meteorological reanalysis, tree-ring-based precipitation reconstructions, satellite-based vegetation products, and interviews with social actors. Large-ensemble climate model outputs are employed to assess changes in the recurrence and intensity of HDs in the near future. This task shed light on the functioning of the atmosphere–hydrosphere–biosphere–social system in a Mediterranean-like region under extreme events and is timely given the prospect of a drier climate for central Chile during the rest of the 21st century. Overall, we found that the acute impacts of the HDs are modulated by precedent conditions, mainly in those systems with long memory (e.g., groundwater and vegetation) and the social context in which they occur (e.g., rural population fraction). Furthermore, extremely low precipitation causes some systems to react in a way that substantially departs from the climate-response relationship established under more benign conditions, including moderate droughts.},
